> The simplest argument for Systemd as the realization of FLOS is to take a look at the [list of features](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/why.html) in this justification for Systemd. Even a Linux sysadmin/power user will be spending some time with google figuring out what many of the things Systemd does _are_ &mdash; it doesnâ€™t do one thing well, because it does _fucking everything_.

Paul Eberhart, "[Linux Future](http://www.pappp.net/?p=969)"

> This entire discussion around the FLOS is not just about bad ideas, it is about the economics of bad ideas and about looking at how we can learn from those experiments and make something better.
