> Your domain model is not in your classes, it's in the communication patterns between the objects at runtime.

Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce, _Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_, Addison Wesley, 2009.

> Procedural code gets information then makes decisions.  Object-oriented code tells objects to do things.
