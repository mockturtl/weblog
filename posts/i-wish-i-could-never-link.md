>This is an honest question: Having been in IT and software development for over a decade, I have never encountered a problem that required me to look at the source code. As such, I've never really understood the open source movement. I can't imagine a scenario where the software I am using, the same software used by hundreds of thousands of others, would be broken to the point where I had to go into the source and fix it. I can't even imagine going into the source to figure out how it works-- usually the documentation and online help is sufficient.

You know?  Someone employs that person.  Pays him.  Real dollars.
