"Vortex of mediocrity"

> When working with legacy code, giving up means neither replacing nor rescuing the legacy code, but simply living with it, learning to adjust my expectations to its quirky behavior, figuring out how to get it mostly out of my way, but with one considerable downside: when push comes to shove, I canâ€™t change it, so I have to waste time and effort working around it, rather than making it better.
